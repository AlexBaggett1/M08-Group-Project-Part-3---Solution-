Student Management System




How it works:
The programs ask how many students are in your class. You input the number of students, and it will prompt the names, ID or Seat number, and grade that the student has. After putting in all the students, you asked for; it will show what you have put in.


It will look like this:

Enter the number of students in the class: 2
Enter name: Alex
Enter student ID: 11
Enter the percent that the student has: 90.0


And it should output something like this:

Student Information:
Name: Alex
Student ID: 11
Grade: 90%
